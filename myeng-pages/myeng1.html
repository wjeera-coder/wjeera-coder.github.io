<ul>
<li>[adventage]
<ol>
<li>A major advantage of SQP is that the iterates x_k need not to be feasible points, since the computation of feasible points in case of nonlinear constraint functions may be as difficult as the solution of the NLP itself.
<li>This is a major advantage since finding a feasible point when there are nonlinear constraints may be nearly as hard as solving (NLP) itself.
<li>The advantage of creating your own functions and classes is that you’ll know exactly how they work.

<li>[use]
<ol>
<li>Java (like most other languages) requires that variables be declared before they are used.
<li>Blocks of code have additional properties and uses. However, the main reason for their existence is to create logically inseparable units of code.
<li>Identifiers are used to name things, such as classes, variables, and methods.
<li>Floating-point numbers, also known as real numbers, are used when evaluating expressions that require fractional precision.
<li>A programming language uses control statements to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on changes to the state of a program.
<li>An SQP method uses a quadratic model for the objective function and a linear model of the constraint.
<li>Image depth or the color depth is the number of bits used to represent a color of a pixel.
<li>Programs that use these library types are easier to write, easier to understand, and much less error-prone.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[usual/usually]
<ol>
<li>Error messages usually contain a line number and a brief description of what the compiler believes we have done wrong.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[vary]
<ol>
<li>The command used to run the C++ compiler varies across compilers and operating systems. The most common compilers are the GNU compiler and the Microsoft Visual Studio compilers.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[way]
<ol>
<li>R is notorious for allowing users to solve problems in many ways.
<li>There are many ways to get the same result in R, and some are very slow.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[what]
<ol>
<li>To establish your primary purpose simply ask yourself what you want your readers to know, to believe, or to be able to do after they have finished reading what you have written.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[when]
<ol>
<li>Floating-point numbers, also known as real numbers, are used when evaluating expressions that require fractional precision.
<li>Compile-time errors occur when you violate the syntax rules of the Java language.
<li>When naming a variable, you should choose a name that is meaningful.
<li>This is a major advantage since finding a feasible point when there are nonlinear constraints may be nearly as hard as solving (NLP) itself.
<li>When there are only equality constraints the solution to a quadratic program reduces to the solution of a linear system of equations.
<li>When you have established your purpose, your readers’ needs, and your scope and have completed your research and your outline, you will be
well prepared to write a first draft.
<li>Efficient code is also concise, elegant, and easy to maintain, which is vital when working on large projects.
<li>C++, like C, is designed to let programs get close to the hardware when necessary.
<li>Use an unsigned type when you know that the values cannot be negative.
<li>Initialization is not assignment. Initialization happens when a variable is given a value when it is created.
<li>When we define a variable without an initializer, the variable is default initialized.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[whenever]
<ol>
<li>Whenever a header is updated, the source files that use that header must be recompiled to get the new or changed declarations.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[where]
<ol>
<li>The edge detector should not identify multiple edge pixels where only a single edge exists.
<li>The image is stored in a matrix format, where each pixel has a position in it and can be referenced by the number of the column and row.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[which]
<ol>
<li>Java also provides a decrement operator, which is specified as ––. This operator decreases its operand by one.
<li>Each chapter concludes with a summary, followed by a glossary of defined terms, which together recap the chapter’s most important points.
<li>C++ is a statically typed language, which means that types are checked at compile time.
<li>A scope is a part of the program in which a name has a particular meaning. Most scopes in C++ are delimited by curly braces.
<li>It is usually a good idea to define an object near the point at which the object is first used.
<li>After a reference has been defined, all operations on that reference are actually operations on the object to which the reference is bound.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[while]
<ol>
<li>To take nonlinearities in the constraints into account while maintaining the linearity of the constraints in the subproblem, the SQP method uses a
quadratic model of the Lagrangian function as the objective.
<li>The biggest challenge for a new Java programmer is learning object-oriented programming while learning the Java language.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[who]
<ol>
<li>This book is for anyone who wants to make their R code faster to type, faster to run, and more scalable.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[in which]
<ol>
<li>A nonlinear program in which the objective function is quadratic and the constraints are linear is called a quadratic program (QP).
<li>Data clustering is considered as an unsupervised learning technique in which objects are grouped in unknown predefined clusters.
<li>On the contrary, classification is a supervised learning in which objects are assigned to predefined classes (clusters).
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[with]
<ol>
<li>The great strength of the SQP method is its ability to solve problems with nonlinear constraints.
<li>With an appropriate choice of quadratic subproblem, the SQP method can be viewed as the natural extension of Newton and quasi-Newton methods to the constrained optimization setting.
<li>An image on a computer is a two-dimensional matrix of numbers with each cell in the matrix storing the corresponding pixel value(s) in the image.
<li>Each pixel value in a grayscale image is a single value between 0 and 255, with 0 representing black and 255 representing white.
<li>In 1999 Gary Bradski [Bradski], working at Intel Corporation, launched OpenCV with the hopes of accelerating computer vision and artificial intelligence by providing a solid infrastructure for everyone working in the field.
<li>Objects may communicate with one another, but they’re normally not allowed to know how other objects are implemented — implementation details are hidden within the objects themselves.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[without]
<ol>
<li>Without organization, the material gathered during your research will be incoherent to your readers.
</ol>
<hr>

<li>[who]
<ol>
<li>A comment describes or explains the operation of the program to anyone who is reading its source code.
